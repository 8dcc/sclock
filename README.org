*Simple graphical clock.*

#+TOC: headlines 2

* Description

This project was inspired by [[https://github.com/tsoding/sowon][tsoding/sowon]].

* Building

To build the project, simply clone the repository and run =make= or =make
install=. Then run =./sclock=.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/sclock
$ cd sclock
$ make
...
$ make install
...
$ ./sclock --help
...
#+end_src

* Modes

You can change the mode by providing a keyword when launching the program:

#+begin_src bash
./sclock <keyword>
#+end_src

These are the supported modes:

| Keyword   | Description                                                                       |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~clock~     | Display the current time. Default mode                                            |
| ~stopwatch~ | Start counting from zero                                                          |
| ~pomodoro~  | Same as ~stopwatch~, but the text color changes depending on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique][Pomodoro cycle]] (1) |

Notes:
1. In this case, ~pomodoro~ cycle consists of 25 minutes of work and 5 of
   rest. After 4 work cycles, the rest is 30 minutes instead of 5.

* Keybinds

These are the keybinds common for all modes:

| Key    | Description                         |
|--------+-------------------------------------|
| ~q~, ~ESC~ | Quit the program                    |
| ~t~, ~p~   | Change color palette (theme)        |
| ~g~      | Toggle the grid (dotted background) |
| ~f~, ~F11~ | Toggle full-screen                  |

These are the keybinds specific to the /stopwatch/ and /pomodoro/ modes:

| Key | Description                   |
|-----+-------------------------------|
| ~SPC~ | Pause or resume the stopwatch |
| ~r~   | Reset the stopwatch to zero   |

* Customizing

You can easily change the colors and behavior of the program by editing the
[[src/config.h]] file.

To change the font, you can edit the [[digits.xcf]] file with [[https://www.gimp.org/][GIMP]] and export the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas][atlas]] as a C source file. You will need to modify it a bit, so it includes the
=digits.h= header and uses the =GimpImage= type.
